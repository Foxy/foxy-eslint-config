# Foxy ESLint Config 🦊⚙️

This is a [shared ESLint config](https://eslint.org/docs/developer-guide/shareable-configs) we use in our projects. It extends recommended defaults, adding support for TypeScript, optimizing for Web Components, encouraging key ordering, use of class member naming conventions and more.

To get started, install the package:

```bash
npm install @foxy.io/eslint-config --save-dev
```

And then add it to your configuration file:

```json
{ "extends": "@foxy.io" }
```
